    <h2>Wardrobe Conscious</h2>

      We have had a strange couple of days at work and now, here is what happened. A few colleagues at work were due for
      their routine doctor’s check-up. It is quite usual to brood about what doctors would say? What if they tell you no
      longer can have a sweet tooth? Petrifying, right? What looked unusual to me was they got worked up on what attire
      to wear on their visit. Now the question is will any nurse or practitioner judge you for what you wear?

      <img class="float-start " id="img1" src="wordrobe 1.jpg" alt=""><br>Let’s delve into the world of attire.The entire landscape changed when we started to break things down. It was
      just the idea of changing into a hospital gown, which they hated.

      Several doctors say patients have added strength to call shots than they might understand and it is completely
      fine to visit a doctor in sweats. Nevertheless, practitioners do suggest opting for clothes that you can slip in
      and out safely and comfortably. Additionally, if they are going to check a particular injury, like giving a shot,
      or taking blood, wear clothes that are easy to access, something like a short sleeve shirt or shirt with sleeves
      rolled up. Sparing a thought about the footwear there will be no need to wear heels to the doctor’s office, opt
      for sandals or loafers as you have to remove them. Several times changing into a gown would make patients feel
      both confining and anxious, that’s the time to speak up and get your concerns addressed, after all, there isn’t a
      thing more important than your mental well-being. <br> <br>

     Dressing for an appointment doesn’t imply you need to do something peculiar, it is just about ensuring your
      comfort but someone who takes the trouble to look good when they go to see a doctor is indeed sending a clear
      signal: they respect you enough to put effort into looking good, doctors do appreciate that and conversely just
      rolling out of bed in a sleeveless tee, ragged jeans with particularly bad smell doesn’t somehow set the mood
      right. At the end of it, it all boils down to one thing- You dress for a cause and there is a bigger intent behind
      it.
